## Process

From 5,111 search results for "sea horizon", I picked 3,152 images with a clear horizon line on both sides, and manually labeled the y-coordinate of the horizon line in each image.

I built a custom web-based horizon labeling tool to label the horizon lines. The process takes about 2 hours.

Images are aligned by the horizons and ordered chronologically based on the user upload date.

For the installation, the scrolling is controlled by a knob.
